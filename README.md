# TGBF - Telegram Bot Framework
TGBF is a Telegram bot framework created by @endogen.

## Overview
The framework is build around the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) module and is polling based. [Webhook mode](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Webhooks) is implemented but untested.

### General bot features
* Every command is a plugin
* Plugins can be enabled / disabled without restarting the bot
* Plugins can be updated by drag & dropping the Python file into the bot chat
* Restart or shutdown the bot via command
* Bot can be administered by different users
* Bot can send current logfile over Telegram (download)
* Admin can query data from the various databases directly over Telegram
* Bot has a web-interface and every plugin can have multiple web endpoints

## Configuration
This part is only relevant if you want to host this bot yourself.  
Before starting up the bot you have to take care of some settings and add a Telegram API token. The configuration file, toke file and wallet file are located in the `config` folder.

### config.json
This file holds the configuration for the bot. You have to at least edit the value for __admin_id__. Everything else is optional.

- __admin - ids__: This is a list of Telegram user IDs that will be able to control the bot. You can add your own user or multiple users if you want. If you don't know your Telegram user ID, get in a conversation with Telegram bot [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) and if you write him (anything) he will return you your user ID.
- __admin - notify_on_error__: If set to `true` then all user IDs in the "admin - ids" list will be notified if some error comes up.
- __telegram - read_timeout__: Read timeout in seconds as integer. Usually this value doesn't have to be changed.
- __telegram - connect_timeout__: Connect timeout in seconds as integer. Usually this value doesn't have to be changed.
- __webhook - listen__: Required only for webhook mode. IP to listen to.
- __webhook - port__: Required only for webhook mode. Port to listen on.
- __webhook - privkey_path__: Required only for webhook mode. Path to private key  (.pem file).
- __webhook - cert_path__: Required only for webhook mode. Path to certificate (.pem file).
- __webhook - url__: Required only for webhook mode. URL under which the bot is hosted.
- __database__ - __use_db__: If `true` then new database files (SQLite) will be created if a plugin tries to execute some SQL statements. If `false`, no databases will be used.

### token.json
This file holds the Telegram bot token. You have to provide one and you will get it in a conversation with Telegram bot [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) while registering your bot.

If you don't want to provide the token in a file then you have two other options:
- Provide it as a command line argument: `-tkn <your token>`
- Provide it as an input on the command line (**MOST SECURE**): `-input-tkn`

## Usage
In order to run the bot you need to execute it with the Python interpreter. If you don't have any idea where to host the bot, take a look at [Where to host Telegram Bots](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Where-to-host-Telegram-Bots). Services like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (free) will work fine. You can also run the script locally on your own computer for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
##### Python version
You have to use at least __Python 3.7__ to execute the scripts. Older versions are not supported.

##### Installing needed modules from `requirements.txt`
In order to be able to run the bot you will need to install some dependencies.

Install all needed Python modules

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3.9-dev
pipenv --python 3.9
pipenv install
```

### Starting
First you have to make the script `run.sh` executable with

```shell
chmod +x run.sh
```

Then run it to get the bot up with

```shell
pipenv shell
./run.sh &
```

### Stopping
The recommended way to stop the bot is by using the bot command `/shutdown` (only possible for admins). If you don't want or can't use the command, you can shut the bot down with:

```shell
./kill.sh
```

### Autocomplete for commands
If you want to show a list of available commands as you type, open a chat with Telegram bot [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and execute the command `/setcommands`. Then choose the bot you want to activate the list for and after that send the list of commands with description. Something like this:

```
about - Show info about bot and dev
address - Your wallet address
balance - Your TAU balance
chart - TAU price & volume chart
feedback - Send me your feedback
help - Show all available commands
price - Current TAU price
send - <amount> <address>
stats - Price change, volume & supply
tip - <amount>
```

## Development
The bot is under active development. If you want to help out you can report issues or create PRs.

### Plugins
If you decide to write your own plugin, check out the [Plugin Page](https://github.com/Endogen/T2X-Bot/tree/master/t2xbot/plugins) to read up on how to create a plugin and know about available plugins.
