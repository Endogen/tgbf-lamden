Provide at least one and up to five search terms that will then be plotted in relation to each other based on the number of search hits they got on Google. The last argument you provide needs to be the time frame in days, months or years or 'all' for the max available time frame.

`/{{handle}} <term> ... <time frame>d|m|y`

Example: Compare search hits for "Bitcoin", "Ethereum" and "Ripple" for the past year  
`/{{handle}} bitcoin ethereum ripple 1y`

Example: Show search hits for "tesla" for the max available time frame  
`/{{handle}} tesla all`
