You can send TAU to last active users in the group by specifying the total amount of TAU to distribute, and the time frame in which users needed to write something in the group to be considered for the rain. The time frame can be in minutes or hours. If you don't specify a time frame then 'last three hours' is the default.
`/{{handle}} <amount> (<time frame>)`

Rain 100 TAU on users active in last 10 minutes  
`/{{handle}} 100 10m`

Rain 500 TAU on users active in last 3 hours  
`/{{handle}} 500 3h`
